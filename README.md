### General information
This project was very simple, but I thought it was a great way to map out the keycodes of the characters on your keyboard. After starting a CS50 online course, and having learned about ACII AKA the binary charts, its cool to do a project showcasing that information.
I have started using template literals more and more in my practice projects, and I am becoming increasignly comfortable using them.
